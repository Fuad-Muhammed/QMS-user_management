## Introduction

The questionnaire management system is a web-based application that enables users to create, assign, and respond to questionnaires. The system is designed using a microservice architecture to provide a flexible, scalable, and modular platform that can be customized to meet the specific needs of each organization. The system consists of the following microservices:

1.  Authentication and Authorization Service
2.  Questionnaire Design Service
3.  Questionnaire Response Service
4.  Notification Service
5.  Reporting Service

## Functional Requirements

### Authentication and Authorization Service
#### User Management

-   The system shall provide user management capabilities to allow administrators to add, modify, and delete user accounts.
-   The system shall provide role-based access control to restrict access to certain features and data based on user roles.
-   The system shall support authentication and authorization through JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
-  The system shall provide an API for creating and editing user profiles.
-   The system shall store user details, preferences, and settings in a database for future retrieval.

### Questionnaire Design Service

#### Questionnaire Management

-   The system shall provide the ability to create and manage questionnaire templates.
-   The system shall allow users to define questions, answer options, and validation rules for each questionnaire template.
-   The system shall support versioning of questionnaire templates, including archiving and restoring previous versions.

### Questionnaire Response Service

#### Response Management

-   The system shall provide an API for submitting responses to questionnaires.
-   The system shall validate responses based on the validation rules defined in the questionnaire template.
-   The system shall store responses in a database for future retrieval and analysis.

### Notification Service

#### Notification Management

-   The system shall send notifications to users based on events in the system, such as when a new questionnaire is assigned to them or when a response to a questionnaire is submitted.
-   The system shall support multiple notification channels, such as email, SMS, and push notifications.
- It would use a messaging system or event bus to communicate with other microservices. Examples of popular messaging systems include Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS).

### Reporting Service

#### Report Generation

-   The system shall provide an API for querying response data and generating reports based on that data.
-   The system shall support aggregation and summarization of response data.
-   The system shall support multiple report formats, such as PDF, CSV, and Excel.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

-   The system shall be able to handle a high volume of concurrent requests.
-   The system shall have a response time of less than 2 seconds for 95% of requests.

### Scalability

-   The system shall be horizontally scalable to handle increased load.
-   The system shall support load balancing and failover to ensure high availability.

### Security

-   The system shall implement industry-standard security practices, including encryption of sensitive data, secure user authentication, and role-based access control.
-   The system shall be regularly audited and tested for security vulnerabilities.

### Usability

-   The system shall be designed with a user-friendly interface that is easy to use and navigate.
-   The system shall provide clear and concise error messages and feedback to users.
